# 🎓 College Mate

**College Mate** is a personal project turned daily essential — crafted using **SwiftUI**, **SwiftData**, and native Apple frameworks to help college students stay focused and organized. Track attendance, store subject-wise notes (PDFs & images only), and manage your timetable — all within a clean, beautifully designed interface.

---

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a student myself, I constantly ran into two frustrating problems:

1. **Checking attendance was a hassle** – In my college, students need 75%+ attendance to appear in exams, but the current system is slow and outdated.
2. **Notes got lost easily** – Important screenshots and PDFs would get buried under random images and memes in the gallery.

That’s why I created **College Mate** — to:
- Provide a fast, clean UI to **track attendance per subject**
- Let users **store only subject-relevant images and PDFs** from the Photos or Files app
- Offer a **visually rich card-style layout** that’s simple, organized, and intuitive
