## 🧠 Why I Built This

Two everyday pain points inspired College Mate:

1. Checking attendance was slow and frustrating — yet essential to meet the 75% rule.
2. Important study notes (screenshots/PDFs) got buried among unrelated photos.

College Mate solves this by:
- Providing a fast, clean UI to track attendance per subject
- Storing only subject‑relevant images and PDFs
- Keeping everything organized in a beautiful, distraction‑free layout
